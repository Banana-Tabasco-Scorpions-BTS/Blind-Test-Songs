## Notes
https://github.com/Banana-Tabasco-Scorpions-BTS/React_Vanilla -- The client has been deployed from the main branch of this repository.
https://github.com/Banana-Tabasco-Scorpions-BTS/Blind-Test-Songs/tree/server-logic-endpoints -- The server has been deployed from the 'server-logic-endpoints' branch. The client from this repo can be safely deleted.

We suggest a full cleanup of the repositories into only 2 repos (1 client and 1 server) before starting to dig into the code itself.


## Installation

Don't forget to run this first command to install dependencies:
```
npm run i
```
And this one to build and run your server (the server runs on transpiled code):
```
npm run dev
```
